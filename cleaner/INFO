for language/sql_query/

every text file is a table in your sql file

you can determine the query through the text files.
example: you want only female speaker with a hessen dialect then put "female" in gender.txt and "hessen" in dialect.txt


the "_not.txt" refers to exceptions. 
example: you want all dialects except "hessen" then put "hessen" in the dialaect_not.txt


!!! if you change the txt names or add more .txt files you screw the script          !!!
!!! only change content of the files - if you dont want use some them let them blank !!!
